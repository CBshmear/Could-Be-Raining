# Could-Be-Raining

## Description
I wanted to be able to access weather data by the name of a given city, anywhere in the world. Now I am able to do just that! When I enter the name of a city, I am given the current forecast as well as the future-cast for the following five days. Thoughtout the development of this webpage I have learned alot about working with server-side API's. Not only working with the API, but also working with the data it provides me. How to access the data I want and how to add that data to the page as I see fit.
